# Data-Analytics
This repository is for some of my data analytics works that I've done so far. 
The CoVID-19 analytics is done using the data available in the early days of it's outbreak, Therefore the data is not upto date. The files used has been uploaded as well.
Libraries used:
So far I used the folium library for geolocation data plotting.
Pandas, numpy, etc. were used for cleaning and pre processing data.
